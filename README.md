# shuffleCard

**Project** <br>
Total 52 cards containing 1-13 of each Spade(S), Heart(H), Diamond(D), Club(C) will be
given to n people randomly.

**Total time I have spent for this project** <br>
It took me 10 hours to complete this project

**How I built?** <br>
I created a card distributor using JavaScript and PHP, and it was built and run using Docker. As I had never used PHP before, I developed this program primarily with JavaScript. 

**Logic** <br>

1. Create an array for a card deck and shuffle it.
2. Obtain the number of players from an input value and prepare an array with the same number of players.
3. Calculate the number of cards to be distributed and loop through to provide cards to players equally.
4. Based on the array, create an interface.
5. Additionally, preserve the data in the local storage so that  the data is not lost after reloading the page.
6. If the user clicks the reset button, all data and UI will be reset.
